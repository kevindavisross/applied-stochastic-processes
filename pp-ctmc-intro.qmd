# Introduction to Continuous Time Markov Chains {.unnumbered}


(@) Let $\{X(t),t\ge0\}$ be a continuous time Markov chain with
state space $S=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and
transition rate matrix $Q$:

$$
\mathbf{Q} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
2 &  & 2 & 0\\
0 & 3 &  & 3\\
4 & 0 & 4 & \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

a. Find the diagonal entries of $\mathbf{Q}$.
a. Explain in full detail how you could simulate the process for a long time using only (1) a coin, and (2) an Exponential(1) spinner.


(@) A system is composed of $5$ machines.
A machine operates for an Exponentially distributed amount of time with rate $\mu=1$ and then fails.
When a machine fails it undergoes repair; repair times are Exponential distributed with rate $\lambda=2$.
Let $X(t)$ represent the number of machines operating at time $t$; then $\{X(t)\}$ is a CTMC.
Find the rate matrix of the CTMC.
