(@) Suppose that the price (dollars) of a stock can be reasonably modeled as a Geometric Brownian motion with drift $\mu=0.05$ per year and scale parameter $\sigma = 0.20$ per year.
Compute the probability that the stock price 2 years from now is 10% greater than the stock price 1 year from now.

(@) Let $U(t)$ represent the difference (in percentage points) between an interest rate and some benchmark.
(For example, $U$ is 0 when the interest rate is equal to the benchmark, $U$ is -1 if the interest rate is 1 percentage point below the benchmark, etc.)
Assume that $U(t)$ follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
If the interest rate is currently 3 percentage points below the benchmark, find the probability that the interest rate is more than 1.5 percentage point below the benchmark 2 units of time from now.
