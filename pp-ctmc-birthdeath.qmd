# Birth and Death Chains {.unnumbered}



*The process below is not a birth and death chain, but a problem similar to this one can be found in the Birth and Death Chain handout.*


The weather in a certain city can be in one of 3 states: sunny (1), cloudy (2), or rainy (3).
Suppose the weather evolves over time according to a continuous time Markov chain with the following transition rate matrix.
Rates are all per day (24 hours).
(Diagonals left blank on purpose.)

$$
\mathbf{Q} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	 & 0.25 & 0\cr
	 0.8& & 0.4\cr
	 2.0& 1.5& \cr	
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Given that it is currently cloudy, compute the expected number of days elapsed from now until it is sunny.
